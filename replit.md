## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Client-side routing using page visibility toggling
- Responsive design with gradient backgrounds

**Design Decisions:**
- **Single Page Application (SPA) Pattern**: Uses a custom page navigation system where all pages are loaded in the DOM and toggled via CSS classes. This provides instant navigation without server requests.
  - *Rationale*: Simplifies deployment and reduces complexity for a small-scale application
  - *Trade-off*: All content loads upfront, which may impact initial load time as the application grows

- **Component Structure**: The application uses a page-based architecture with distinct sections:
  - Home/Landing page with benefits showcase
  - Login/Registration flow
  - Rating system functionality
  
- **Styling Approach**: Utilizes a custom CSS solution with:
  - CSS variables for theming (gradient backgrounds, dark headers)
  - Reusable header components (`.header`, `.header-dark`, `.header-simple`)
  - Card-based benefit display system

**Navigation System:**
- Custom `navigateTo()` function manages page transitions
- Page state managed through `.active` CSS class
- Automatic scroll-to-top on navigation

### Backend Architecture

**Current State**: 
- No backend implementation present in the repository
- Purely client-side application at this stage

**Anticipated Requirements**:
